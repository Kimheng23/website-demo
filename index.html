            <h2>Ancient Greece</h2>
            <p>Ancient Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization. It was a collection of city-states, the most famous being Athens and Sparta. It saw the rise of democracy, philosophy, art, and science. Ancient Greece refers to the period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages(c.1200-800 BCE) to the Roman conquest of Greece(146 BCE).</p>

            <h2>Medieval Greece</h2>
            <p>During the Byzantine Empire, Greece was a significant cultural and political center. Christianity became dominant and many ancient texts were preserved by scholars. Medieval Greece encompasses the Byzantine Empire's control over the region from the 4th century AD until the 15th century, along with periods of Frankish and Venetian rule after the Fourth Crusade.</p>

            <h2>Modern Greece</h2>
            <p>Greece gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Today, it is a democratic republic and a member of the European Union. Established in 1830, the nation state quickly faced challenges, including the "Megali Idea" (the dream of uniting all Greek-speaking lands) and periods of political instability and authoritarian rule. Despite these hurdles, Greece has developed into a prosperous liberal democracy, a member of the EU, and a significant player in the Mediterranean region.</p>
